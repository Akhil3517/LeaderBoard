# Leaderboard System

This project is a responsive, modern leaderboard web application that allows users to:
- Select or add a user
- Claim random points for the selected user
- View a dynamic, real-time leaderboard with user rankings
- See a clean, visually appealing UI with a trophy-themed background

The system is built with a Node.js/Express backend (with MongoDB) and a React.js frontend, following best practices for code structure, reusability, and responsiveness.
